So, you set up a new development environment of HIL 
on a VM. Now, how do you try out commands, start hacking ?

You will need some dummy data. That is what these bunch of 
scripts do. 

`haas.cfg` provides you a sample way to set up HIL
just stick into the root directory of your HIL environment.

After that run the HIL command to initialize the database.
Currently that is 

`haas-admin db create`

then create your first admin user. 
You will need this if you wish to play with user authentication
system. 

`haas create_admin_user <username> <password>`

input the credentials into the `client_env`
source this into your environment

` source client_env`

Now just run the script

`populateHaaS.sh`

This should give you:

6 nodes, with ipmi obm driver
3 projects with nodes allocated to them. 

You can change the script to fit your needs. 

Happy HACKING !!
